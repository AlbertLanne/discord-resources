This resource was made by the Beautiful Discord community and wouldn't be possible without you! We appreciate and recognize [all contributors](https://github.com/beautiful-discord-community/resources/graphs/contributors).


# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add, remove, or change things on the list:** Submit a pull request

- List items should be sorted *alphabetically*.
- Each item should be limited to one link
- The link should be the name of the package or project
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line

Please contribute links to packages/projects you have used or are familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.

If you removed our PR template you can find it [here](https://github.com/beautiful-discord-community/resources/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md).

## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you would like to discuss anything that could be improved or have suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes packages fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for extended periods of time, so if you see that, feel free to change its listing or let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental.

Removal changes will not be applied until they have been pending for a minimum of 1 week (7 days). This grace window benefits projects that may be going through a temporary transition but are otherwise worthy of being on the list.

Thanks everyone!
